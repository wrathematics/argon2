Title: Secure Password Hashing
Version: 0.1-1
Description: Utilities for secure password hashing via the argon2 algorithm.
    It is a relatively new hashing algorithm and is believed to be very secure.
    The 'argon2' implementation included in the package is the reference
    implementation.  The package also includes some utilities that should be
    useful for digest authentication, including a wrapper of 'blake2b'.  For
    similar R packages, see sodium and 'bcrypt'.
